# [VolkodavWeather](https://github.com/NikitaVolkodav/VolkodavWeather) 

I developed VolkodavWeather order to learn URLSession, REST API. I used [OpenWether](https://openweathermap.org/api) API all of my weather needs. I accessed current weather data, daily forecasts for any location including over 376,000 cities. Used URLSession for network data transfer tasks. 

When app starts, you can see city name, current temperature, minimum and maximum temperature, date and weather description. You can check the weather forecast of the city you want.

  # AutoMobi

  Automobi is a cutting-edge mobile application that has been developed as a hands-on learning project to gain proficiency in URLSession and REST API concepts. The app utilizes REST API to efficiently communicate with backend systems and facilitate seamless data transfer tasks using URLSession.

The main screen of the app displays the name of the vehicles, along with their corresponding prices, specifications, publication date, and description of the seller. This information is carefully organized in a visually appealing manner, providing users with a clear overview of the vehicles' key details at a glance.

The name of the vehicles gives users an indication of the make and model of the cars available for sale, helping them quickly identify the listings that match their preferences. The prices are prominently displayed, allowing users to easily compare the costs of different vehicles and make informed decisions based on their budget. The specifications provide users with details such as the year, mileage, engine type, and other relevant information about the vehicles, helping them assess their suitability for their needs.

The publication date of the listings is also provided, giving users an idea of how recently the vehicles have been listed on the app. This information can be helpful in identifying new listings or ones that have been available for a longer period of time. Additionally, the description of the seller provides users with insights into the seller's perspective and any additional information they may have shared about the vehicles, creating a more transparent and informative buying experience.

Overall, the user-friendly interface of Automobi presents users with all the relevant information they need to make informed decisions about the vehicles available for buying and selling. The carefully organized and visually appealing display of vehicle names, prices, specifications, publication dates, and seller descriptions makes it easy for users to quickly browse through the listings and find the perfect car for their needs.
