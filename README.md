 # [WebFilter](https://github.com/NikitaVolkodav/WebFilter) 

I have created a new application called WebFilter, where I delved into WebKit and its properties. In this project, I implemented the creation of UI elements using code instead of Storyboard. The purpose of this application is to work with the Google search engine and add filters that restrict access to specific websites matching the filter criteria.

With WebFilter, users can easily add filters to their Google search results. Once a filter is applied, Google will prevent access to any websites that match the filter. This feature provides a convenient way to customize and refine search results based on specific preferences or requirements.

By leveraging WebKit's capabilities and utilizing code-based UI creation, WebFilter offers a seamless user experience. Users can navigate through the application effortlessly, accessing a variety of options to enhance their Google search functionality.

WebFilter simplifies the process of managing search results by empowering users to control the content they encounter while using Google. With just a few clicks, users can add filters to exclude unwanted websites, ensuring a more tailored and efficient search experience.

Overall, I am proud to present this new application that showcases my exploration of WebKit and demonstrates my ability to create UI elements programmatically. WebFilter provides an innovative solution for filtering Google search results, giving users more control over their online browsing experience.

 # [CurrencyConverter](https://github.com/NikitaVolkodav/CurrencyConvert) 

- Offline Currency Conversion: The app is designed to work without internet connectivity, thanks to the use of UserDefaults. This means that users can perform currency conversions even when they are offline, making it convenient for travelers or users in areas with limited internet access.
- UISegmentedControl for Exchange Rate Selection: The app features a UISegmentedControl that allows users to switch between different exchange rates for buying and selling currencies. This gives users flexibility in choosing the exchange rate that best suits their needs.
- Currency Search with UISearchBar and AVAudioEngine: The app provides a currency search feature that allows users to easily find and add currencies to the main screen. Users can search for currencies by entering text in a UISearchBar, or they can even use AVAudioEngine to perform voice-based currency searches, making it convenient and user-friendly.
- Currency Sharing: The app allows users to share currency information with others using various sharing options, such as sharing through messenger apps or other communication channels. This enables users to easily share currency rates or conversion results with friends, family, or colleagues.
- API Request and Error Handling: The app utilizes new knowledge in API request handling by implementing URLComponents for building API URLs, and includes error handling for bad status codes, bad URLs, bad server responses, and no data errors. This ensures that the app can handle different scenarios and provide appropriate feedback to the user in case of any errors.
Overall, the Currency Converter Application is a comprehensive iOS app that provides offline currency conversion, flexible exchange rate selection, easy currency search, convenient currency sharing, and robust error handling using various iOS development tools and techniques.
- In addition to the technical components mentioned earlier, the Currency Converter Application also supports both horizontal and vertical orientations, providing a seamless user experience in both orientations.

# [VolkodavWeather](https://github.com/NikitaVolkodav/VolkodavWeather) 

I developed VolkodavWeather order to learn URLSession, REST API. I used [OpenWether](https://openweathermap.org/api) API all of my weather needs. I accessed current weather data, daily forecasts for any location including over 376,000 cities. Used URLSession for network data transfer tasks. 

When app starts, you can see city name, current temperature, minimum and maximum temperature, date and weather description. You can check the weather forecast of the city you want.
